Even Fibonacci numbers
======================
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Answer
======
Include divides extension function.

    implicit def Integer2Divides(n: Int) = new {
      def divides(m: Int) = m % n == 0
    }

Use the infinite list abstraction in `Stream` to implement. Pin the list to
itself shifted left a place and sum the tuples.

    val fibs: Stream[Int] = 0 #:: 1 #:: fibs.zip(fibs.tail).map { case (n, m) => n + m }

Just the even ones not exceeding than four million...

    val evenFibs = fibs filter { 2 divides _ }
    val boundedEvenFibs = evenFibs takeWhile { _ <= 4000000 }

    val answer = boundedEvenFibs.sum
    println(answer)
